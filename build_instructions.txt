= README to build DOOM for iOS =

1. Once Git repository is cloned go into DoomClassic directory and run:

  $ ./extract_files.sh <ipa file>

e.g.

  $ ./extract_files.sh DOOM\ 2.7.ipa

This will copy all the files from the ipa file that you need into the correct locations.

2. Make sure Xcode is installed and then open the xcode workspace:

  $ open DoomClassics.xcworkspace

3. Xcode should open and then click on "General" tab.
  a. Bundle Identifier should be unique but probably stay the same.
  b. Need to make sure you can sign the app.  Tested with Personal Team (e.g. free developer account).

4. Click on Play button on top of xcode window to build and run app in simulator (the device to simulate is also there).

5. Should build and play in a simulator.

6. Plug your iOS device into the Mac running Xcode and it should be an option where tyou specify the device to build for.

7. It should install on the iOS device and run.  If Personal Team account used then it needs reinstalling every 7 days.

8. Have fun...
